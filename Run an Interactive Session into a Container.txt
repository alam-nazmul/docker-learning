## In order to interactively connect into a container shell session, and run commands as you do on any other Linux session, issue the following command:

docker run -it ubuntu bash


## To reconnect to the running container you need the container ID or name. Issue docker ps command to get the ID or name and, then, run docker attach command by specifying container ID or name, as illustrated in the image above:

docker attach <container id>


## To stop a running container from the host session issue the following command:

docker kill <container id>
